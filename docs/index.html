    <h3>
      <a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Get content directly
      to where it's actionable</h3>
    <p>You could have people email in bug reports and feedback, but then your job is to copy and paste this content into GitHub
      issues every day. That's no fun.</p>
    <h3>
      <a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Customizable</h3>
    <p>Via <code>FeedbackManagerDatasource</code> you can provide the labels you want assigned to each issue, as well as any
      arbitrary data that could be useful in troubleshooting.</p>
    <h3>
      <a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Screenshots are
      key</h3>
    <p>The report feedback interface displays when a user takes a screenshot of your application.</p>
    <p>Seeing is believing. It's not that people file bad bugs, of course not, I'd never say that. (I would). But seeing what
      they see is the difference between <i>"That one screen with the thing didn't look right"</i> and actually fixing a
      problem.</p>
    <p>Plus you own the screenshots. With other user feedback services the screenshots are hosted by them and live for eternity.
      Here the screenshots are hosted on your own Google Cloud Storage bucket, and you can even lock them down with signed
      URLs if you want. </p>
    <h3>
      <a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h3>
    <ol>
      
      <li>In your Podfile add:<br>
        <code>pod 'GitYourFeedback', :git => 'https://github.com/gabek/GitYourFeedback'</code>
        <br>or your Cartfile:
        <br><code>github "gabek/GitYourFeedback"</code>
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        Generate a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/">Personal Access Token</a> for the GitHub user who will be saving the issues in your repo.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        In your project's <code>Info.plist</code> add a key of <code>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</code> with a string explaining that your use of the photo library is for submitting screenshots. This is user-facing so use your own judgement.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        In your AppDelegate or some other place of your choice that sticks around for the lifetime of your app, add an instance of
        FeedbackManager using your GitHub Personal Access Token, your GitHub username, and the repo you'd like to create
        the issues in. This user needs access to create issues in the repo specified.
        <pre><code>var feedbackManager
func setupFeedbackManager() {
   feedbackManager = FeedbackManager(githubApiToken: "abc123", githubUser: "reesedewhat", repo: "gabek/MyReallyCoolProject", datasourceDelegate: self)
}</pre></code>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Implement FeedbackManagerDatasource's <code>uploadUrl:completionHandler</code> method to point to a valid Google Storage bucket. This
        bucket needs access for you to read and write to. It can look like this:
        <br>
        <pre><code>func uploadUrl(_ completionHandler: (String) -&gt; Void) {
    let filename = String(Date().timeIntervalSince1970) + ".jpg"
    let url = "https://www.googleapis.com/upload/storage/v1/b/mybucketname.appspot.com/o?name=\(filename)"
    completionHandler(url)
}
</code></pre>
      Obviously use your real Google Cloud Storage upload bucket.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        There are other methods you can optionally implement as well, to provide additional information in the issues that get filed.
        <pre><code>func additionalData() -> String?
func issueLabels() -> [String]?
</pre></code> will allow you to supply an arbitrary string that gets added to the issue when filed, and the issues that are
          assigned to this issue in GitHub respectively.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
      <a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Presenting the Feedback interface
    </h3>
      <p>
        The interface will automatically display as a result of a user taking a screenshot. If this is the first time the user has taken a screenshot in your application they will be greeted with an iOS permissions dialog stating they need to grant your app access to the user's Photos in order to use the screenshot. You may want to emphasize that the user should accept this. It uses the copy you added in your Info.plist's <code>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</code> key.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could also manually fire <code>yourFeedbackManagerInstance.display()</code> with an optional specific view controller to present from. With this approach the user will have to select their own screenshot manually if they want to send one.
      </p>
